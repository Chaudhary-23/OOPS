        "Q1 - What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around *objects* rather than functions and logic. It models real-world entities as objects that have both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). The idea is to structure code so that related data and functionality are bundled together, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Concepts in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Objects:**\n",
        "   - Objects are instances of classes and represent real-world entities or concepts. They hold both **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions or behaviors).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: A `Car` object might have attributes like `make`, `model`, and `color`, and methods like `start_engine()` or `drive()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Classes:**\n",
        "   - A class is a blueprint or template from which objects are created. It defines what attributes and methods its objects will have.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: A `Car` class could define what attributes all cars have (e.g., `make`, `model`, `color`) and what actions they can perform (e.g., `start_engine()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Encapsulation:**\n",
        "   - Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal state of an object and only exposing a controlled interface. This helps protect the objectâ€™s state from unauthorized access and modification.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: A `BankAccount` class might have a private attribute `balance` and provide public methods like `deposit()` and `withdraw()` to modify it.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Inheritance:**\n",
        "   - Inheritance allows one class (child class) to inherit the properties and methods of another class (parent class). It enables code reuse and the creation of more specialized classes from general ones.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: A `Dog` class might inherit from a more general `Animal` class, gaining its attributes and methods but also adding specific features (e.g., `bark()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Polymorphism:**\n",
        "   - Polymorphism allows different objects to be treated as instances of the same class, even if they are of different types. It can manifest as method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method from the parent class).\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: Both `Cat` and `Dog` classes might have a `speak()` method, but each class would provide its own implementation (e.g., \"meow\" for cats, \"bark\" for dogs).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Abstraction:**\n",
        "   - Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by exposing only the necessary details and hiding the internal workings. In OOP, abstract classes or interfaces provide a way to define methods that subclasses must implement, without worrying about how they work.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example: An abstract class `Shape` might define a method `draw()`, and subclasses like `Circle` and `Square` would provide their specific implementation for how to draw the shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2- What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure (attributes) and behavior (methods or functions) that the objects created from the class will have. Essentially, a class is a way to bundle data and the functions that manipulate that data together into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Aspects of a Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Attributes (Properties/Fields):\n",
        "   - Attributes are the data or characteristics that define the object. They represent the state or properties of an object.\n",
        "   - In a class, attributes are usually defined within the constructor or as class variables.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, make, model, color):\n",
        "           self.make = make\n",
        "           self.model = model\n",
        "           self.color = color\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this example, `make`, `model`, and `color` are attributes of the `Car` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Methods (Functions/Behavior):\n",
        "   - Methods are functions defined within a class that describe the behavior or actions an object of the class can perform. Methods typically operate on the attributes of the object.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   class Car:\n",
        "       def __init__(self, make, model, color):\n",
        "           self.make = make\n",
        "           self.model = model\n",
        "           self.color = color\n",
        "       \n",
        "       def start_engine(self):\n",
        "           print(f\"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine starts!\")\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   Here, `start_engine` is a method that describes the behavior of the car object, specifically starting its engine.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Instantiation:\n",
        "   - Once a class is defined, you can create an instance (object) of that class. This process is called instantiation. Each object created from a class has its own set of attributes and can call the methods defined in the class.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Example:\n",
        "   ```python\n",
        "   my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", \"Red\")\n",
        "   my_car.start_engine()  # Output: The Toyota Corolla's engine starts!\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "\n",
        "   In this case, `my_car` is an instance of the `Car` class with specific values for `make`, `model`, and `color`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of a Simple Class:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    # Constructor to initialize attributes\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.breed = breed\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Method to describe behavior\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} is barking!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating an instance of the Dog class\n",
        "my_dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
        "my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy is barking!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Characteristics of a Class:\n",
        "- Constructor (`__init__`):This special method is called when an object is instantiated from the class. It's typically used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "- Instance Variables:These are variables tied to an individual object (instance) and are defined using `self`.\n",
        "- Class Methods:These are methods that define behavior specific to the objects of the class and can modify the instance's state or perform operations using the instance's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3- What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. An object is a self-contained unit that consists of both data (attributes) and behavior (methods). It represents a real-world entity or concept, modeled in code, that can perform specific tasks and hold information.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Creating and Using an Object:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "class Dog:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.breed = breed\n",
        "\n",
        "    def bark(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"{self.name} is barking!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects (instances) of the Dog class\n",
        "dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
        "dog2 = Dog(\"Max\", \"Bulldog\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Calling methods on objects\n",
        "dog1.bark()  # Output: Buddy is barking!\n",
        "dog2.bark()  # Output: Max is barking!\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "- `dog1` and `dog2` are objects (instances) of the `Dog` class.\n",
        "- Each object has its own state (name and breed), and both objects can call the `bark()` method, which is defined in the `Dog` class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4- What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), abstraction and encapsulation are two fundamental concepts, but they focus on different aspects of how data and behavior are managed in a program.\n",
        "1. Abstraction:\n",
        "Definition: Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or interfaces. It allows you to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encapsulation:\n",
        "Definition: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It also involves restricting access to the internal state of the object and only allowing it to be accessed or modified through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5- What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans- Dunder methods (also known as magic methods or special methods) in Python are methods that begin and end with double underscores (__). These methods allows to define how objects of your custom classes behave in certain situations, like when they are used in operations or converted to strings.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods allows to override or customize the default behavior of Python operators and built-in functions. For example, you can define how an object behaves when it's added to another object, compared, or printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some Common Dunder Methods:\n",
        "__init__(self, ...) (Constructor)\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is called when a new object of a class is created. Itâ€™s used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "__str__(self) (String Representation)\n",
        "\n",
        "This method is used to define what the string representation of an object should be when you call print() or str() on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Person:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "        self.age = age\n",
        "\n",
        "    def __str__(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name}, {self.age} years old\"\n",
        "\n",
        "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
        "print(person1)  # Output: Alice, 30 years old\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6- Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans - Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the parent class (or base class), and the class that inherits from it is called the child class (or derived class).\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "# Parent class (also called the base class)\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name):\n",
        "        self.name = name\n",
        "\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return \"Animal sound\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Child class (also called the derived class)\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
        "        # Calling the parent class's constructor\n",
        "        super().__init__(name)\n",
        "        self.breed = breed\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Overriding the 'speak' method from the parent class\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        return f\"{self.name} says Woof!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects of each class\n",
        "generic_animal = Animal(\"Some Animal\")\n",
        "dog = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
        "\n",
        "print(generic_animal.speak())  # Output: Animal sound\n",
        "print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says Woof!\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7- What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism is one of the core concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. It enables the same method or function to behave differently based on the object it is acting upon. Essentially, polymorphism allows for one interface to control access to different types of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "# Parent class\n",
        "class Animal:\n",

        "        return \"Meow!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Function to demonstrate polymorphism\n",
        "def animal_sound(animal: Animal):\n",
        "    print(animal.speak())\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating objects\n",
        "dog = Dog()\n",

        "\n",
        "# Passing objects to the same function\n",
        "animal_sound(dog)  # Output: Woof!\n",
        "animal_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow!\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Method Overriding (Run-Time Polymorphism):\n",
        "In method overriding, a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class. The decision about which method to call is made at runtime, depending on the object type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8-How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans - Encapsulation is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and it refers to the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, or class. It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object's attributes or methods, making the objectâ€™s internal state private and accessible only through public methods (getters and setters). This helps to protect the integrity of the object's data by controlling how it is accessed and modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ways to Achieve Encapsulation:\n",
        "Public Attributes and Methods: These are the default in Python. Public attributes and methods can be accessed directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make  # Public attribute\n",

        "print(car.make)  # Output: Toyota\n",
        "car.display_info()  # Output: Make: Toyota, Model: Corolla\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Private Attributes and Methods (Single Underscore Prefix): By convention, an attribute or method with a single underscore prefix (e.g., _attribute) indicates that it is intended for internal use within the class or module and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. While this does not make the attribute truly private (Python allows access to these attributes), it is a signal to the developer that they should not access or modify them directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",

        "print(car._make)  # Technically accessible, but should be avoided\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Private Attributes and Methods (Double Underscore Prefix): Attributes and methods with a double underscore prefix (e.g., __attribute) are considered private by Python and undergo name mangling. Name mangling means that Python internally changes the name of the attribute so it can't be accessed directly from outside the class. Itâ€™s not completely inaccessible, but it makes it harder to accidentally access or modify.\n",

        "Q9- What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans - In Python, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created. The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the object's attributes and perform any setup or initialization required when the object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the constructor is defined using the __init__ method. This method is not explicitly called; it is automatically invoked when you create a new instance of the class.\n",

        "Q10 - What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans - In Python, class methods and static methods are two types of methods that are bound to the class rather than an instance of the class. They are defined with specific decorators and serve different purposes compared to regular instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class Method:\n",
        "A class method is a method that is bound to the class itself rather than to an instance of the class. It can modify the class state (i.e., class variables) or access class-level data. Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",

        "Ans - Method overloading in Python refers to the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but with different arguments (number or type of arguments). This allows to use the same method name to perform different tasks depending on the input provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Python does not support traditional method overloading like other languages (e.g., Java or C++). In Python, we cannot have multiple methods with the same name in a class. If we define multiple methods with the same name, the last defined method will override the previous ones.\n",

        "Ans - Method overriding in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) refers to the ability of a subclass (derived class) to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass (base class). When a method in the subclass has the same name, same parameters, and same return type as a method in the superclass, the subclass's method \"overrides\" the superclass's method.\n",

        "Ans - In Python, the property decorator is used to define a method as a property, allowing us to define a method that behaves like an attribute. This allows to control access to an instance attribute by providing custom behavior for getting, setting, or deleting an attribute while still using dot notation.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a Property?\n",
        "A property is a special type of attribute that can be accessed and modified like a regular attribute, but with additional functionality behind the scenes.

        "Q14- Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Ans - Polymorphism is one of the four fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, typically through a shared interface or method signature. The term polymorphism comes from Greek, meaning \"many forms,\" and in OOP, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same method or operation in different ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importance of Polymorphism in OOP\n",
        "1- Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "Polymorphism allows to write more flexible and extensible code. Since different classes can implement the same method in their own unique way, we can write generic code that works with any class that implements a particular interface or base class.\n",
        "For example, if we have a method that works with any Animal class (superclass), polymorphism allows to pass objects of different subclasses (e.g., Dog, Cat) to this method, and the correct method for the specific class will be executed. This makes it easier to extend the program with new classes without needing to modify existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "2- Code Reusability:\n",
        "Polymorphism facilitates code reuse by allowing to use the same method or function to operate on objects of different types, as long as they follow the same interface or inherit from the same class.\n",
        "This means we donâ€™t have to write redundant code for every subclass. We can define one method in a superclass, and then subclasses can override it to perform their specific functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "3- Improved Maintainability:\n",
        "When code is more general and reusable, it's easier to maintain. Polymorphism allows to manage and maintain systems that have many different objects behaving in the same way, reducing the need to duplicate logic and keeping codebase changes more localized.\n",
        "If we need to change the behavior for all objects of a certain type, we can modify a method in a common superclass, and the change will propagate to all subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "4 - Dynamic Method Dispatch (Runtime Polymorphism):\n",
        "One of the key benefits of polymorphism is runtime polymorphism (or dynamic method dispatch), which allows the program to decide at runtime which method to invoke based on the actual object type. This is particularly useful when dealing with collections of objects.\n",
        "This dynamic behavior is achieved using method overriding (in subclasses), where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass. This means that the method call will invoke the subclass's version of the method, not the superclass's method.\n",
        "\n",
        "5- Cleaner and More Intuitive Code:\n",
        "Polymorphism can simplify code and make it more intuitive to understand. Instead of dealing with many if-else conditions or type checking to differentiate between object types, polymorphism allows to invoke methods on objects without needing to worry about the type of object at hand. We can focus on what an object does rather than what type it is.\n",
        "For example, if we have a method make_sound() that works with different animals (like dogs, cats, and birds), polymorphism ensures that when we call this method on a Dog object, it barks, and when called on a Cat object, it meows. You donâ€™t need to check the type explicitly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simplifies Code for Interfaces and Abstract Classes:\n",
        "Polymorphism works hand-in-hand with abstract classes and interfaces. By defining abstract methods in a superclass (abstract class or interface), polymorphism allows subclasses to provide their own implementations.\n",
        "This is particularly useful when designing frameworks or libraries, as polymorphism allows to define a generic interface that can be implemented in many different ways by users of the framework, making the code more adaptable and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15- What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Ans- An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes. It allows to define a common interface for a group of related classes, ensuring that subclasses implement certain methods or behaviors. Abstract classes are particularly useful when we want to define a common structure for multiple subclasses but leave the implementation of some methods to those subclasses.\n",
        "Key Concepts:\n",
        "Abstract Methods:\n",
        "Abstract methods are methods that are declared in the abstract class but do not have a body (i.e., no implementation). These methods must be implemented by subclasses.\n",
        "To define an abstract method, we use the @abstractmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract Class:\n",
        "An abstract class can have both abstract methods (without implementation) and regular methods (with implementation).\n",
        "A subclass of an abstract class is required to implement all abstract methods, or it will also be considered an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of an Abstract Class in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
        "class Animal(ABC):  # Animal is an abstract class\n",
        "    @abstractmethod\n",
        "    def sound(self):  # Abstract method (must be implemented by subclasses)\n",

        "Q16- What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) provides numerous advantages that contribute to writing cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code. Here are the key advantages of using OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Modularity\n",
        "Code Organization: OOP organizes code into discrete units called objects (representing real-world entities). This helps in logically grouping related functionality, making the code more understandable and manageable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Separation of Concerns: Each object is self-contained, with its attributes (data) and methods (functions), so different parts of the code can be developed and tested independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Reusability: Objects and classes can be reused across different parts of the program or even in other projects. Once a class is defined, it can be instantiated multiple times without having to redefine the logic.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Encapsulation\n",
        "Hiding Complexity: OOP allows you to hide the internal workings (data and implementation details) of an object and expose only the necessary functionalities through public methods (getters, setters). This is known as data encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Security: Encapsulation provides a mechanism for controlling access to data, which helps protect the integrity of an object by preventing unauthorized access or modifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Inheritance\n",
        "Code Reusability: Inheritance allows a class (child class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from another class (parent class). This promotes code reuse, reducing duplication and making the codebase easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extendable: Inheritance enables you to extend and build on existing functionality. You can create new classes based on existing ones, modifying or adding features as needed without altering the base class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Polymorphism\n",
        "Flexibility: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means you can write generic code that works with objects of various classes, allowing different behaviors for the same interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Simplification: Polymorphism simplifies code by enabling a single method or function to work with objects of different types, avoiding the need for multiple method definitions for each specific type.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Abstraction\n",
        "Simplifies Complex Systems: Abstraction allows you to focus on high-level logic and hide the complex implementation details. You define the interface (what an object can do) and not the internal workings (how it does it).\n",
        "\n",
        "Improves Readability: Abstraction helps in defining clear and simple interfaces for interacting with objects, making the code easier to understand and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Maintainability\n",
        "Easier to Update and Maintain: Since OOP organizes code into small, manageable units (objects), updates or changes to the system can be made with minimal impact on other parts of the program. This makes the codebase more maintainable over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clear Structure: OOP structures the code logically into classes and objects, making it easier to understand the relationships between different parts of the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. Scalability\n",
        "Better Handling of Complexity: OOP is ideal for large-scale applications as it allows for the decomposition of complex problems into smaller, more manageable components. Each object is responsible for a specific piece of functionality, which simplifies scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Easier to Extend: You can easily add new functionality or modify existing behavior by extending classes and using inheritance, without disturbing the existing codebase.\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans- In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are two special (or \"dunder\") methods that define how objects of a class are represented as strings. These methods are used for string representations, but they serve slightly different purposes and are used in different contexts.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. __str__ Method:\n",
        "Purpose: The __str__ method is used to define a \"user-friendly\" or informal string representation of an object. It's meant to provide a readable, easy-to-understand description of the object when it's converted to a string (e.g., when printed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case: The __str__ method is called when you use print() or str() on an object. It is primarily aimed at giving a human-readable output, so the focus is on clarity and simplicity.\n",

        "Purpose: The __repr__ method is used to define an \"official\" or \"developer-friendly\" string representation of an object. Its goal is to provide a string that, ideally, can be used to recreate the object (or at least be unambiguous about its representation). This representation is used in situations where you are debugging or inspecting objects.\n",

        "Q20- What is the significance of the â€˜super()â€™ function in Python?\n",
        "Ans- The super() function in Python is an essential tool in object-oriented programming (OOP) for managing inheritance, especially when dealing with multiple inheritance or method overriding. It provides a way to call methods from a parent or sibling class, allowing you to access the methods of a class higher in the method resolution order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Purposes of super():\n",
        "\n",
        "Accessing Parent Class Methods:\n",
        "super() allows you to call methods from a parent class (or superclass) without explicitly referring to the class name. This is particularly useful in inheritance hierarchies where the parent class methods need to be invoked in the child class, often after performing some additional functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "Avoiding Direct Class References:\n",
        "Using super() enables you to avoid hardcoding the parent class name, which makes your code more maintainable and flexible. If the parent class changes, you don't have to modify your code where the parent class name is explicitly mentioned.\n",
        "\n",
        "Working with Multiple Inheritance:\n",
        "In cases of multiple inheritance, super() helps ensure that the method resolution order (MRO) is followed correctly, so the right class methods are called in the correct order. This is useful for preventing problems like the diamond problem in multiple inheritance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax of super():\n",
        "super().method_name()  # Calls the method from the superclass\n",
        "\n",

        "Ans- The __del__ method in Python is a special method that is used to define the behavior when an object is deleted. It is often referred to as a destructor. The __del__ method is called when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to the object and it is ready to be garbage collected.\n",

        "Q22- What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Ans- In Python, both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators that are used to define methods within a class that are not bound to instances of the class (i.e., they do not require access to instance-specific data). However, they differ in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. @staticmethod:\n",
        "A static method is a method that belongs to the class, rather than to any specific instance. It doesn't have access to the instance (self) or class (cls) variables. It behaves like a regular function but resides within the class's namespace.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "class MathOperations:\n",
        "    @staticmethod\n",
        "    def add(x, y):\n",
        "        return x + y\n",
        "\n",
        "print(MathOperations.add(5, 3))  # Output: 8\n",
        "\n",
        "2. @classmethod:\n",
        "A class method is a method that belongs to the class, and it takes the class itself (cls) as its first parameter, in addition to any other arguments. This allows the method to access class-level attributes and modify class state, but not instance-specific data. Class methods are often used for factory methods or methods that need to access class-level information, but not instance-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "class Car:\n",

        "Q23- How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "Ans- Polymorphism in Python, especially when used with inheritance, is a powerful concept that allows different classes to respond to the same method call in their own unique way. The term polymorphism comes from the Greek words \"poly\" (meaning many) and \"morph\" (meaning forms), indicating the ability of different classes to share the same method names while providing different behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Polymorphism Works in Python with Inheritance:\n",
        "Method Overriding:\n",
        "Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding in Python, where a method in a child class overrides a method in a parent class.\n",
        "This allows a child class to provide its specific implementation of a method, while the same method name in the parent class might have a different implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Dispatch:\n",
        "Python uses dynamic dispatch to determine which method to call. This means that the method that is called is determined at runtime based on the object type, not the variable type.\n",
        "Even though the variable holding the object might be of the parent class type, Python will call the method that is defined in the actual object (which could be the child class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Same Method Name, Different Implementations:\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can have the same method name in both parent and child classes, but the method in the child class will override the one in the parent class.\n",
        "When you call this method on an instance of the child class, the child classâ€™s version of the method is executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Polymorphism Using Inheritance:\n",
        "class Animal:\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
        "\n",
        "class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "    def speak(self):\n",
        "        print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
        "\n",
        "# Creating instances\n",
        "animal = Animal()\n",

        "animals = [animal, dog, cat]\n",
        "\n",
        "for animal in animals:\n",
        "    animal.speak()  # Calls the appropriate 'speak' method based on the actual object type\n",
        "\n",
        "Output:\n",
        "Animal makes a sound\n",
        "Dog barks\n",
        "Cat meows\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24- What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Ans- Method chaining in Python (and in Object-Oriented Programming in general) refers to the practice of calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code, where each method returns the object itself (or another object of the same class). This allows you to \"chain\" method calls together.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, method chaining helps to write cleaner and more compact code by eliminating the need for multiple lines of method calls. The key is that each method in the chain returns self (the object itself) or another instance of the same class, so further method calls can be made on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Method Chaining Works:\n",
        "A method in a class should return the object (self) in order for you to chain other methods to it.\n",
        "When a method call returns self, it allows you to call another method on that same instance in a single line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Method chaining is especially useful for configuring or modifying an object step-by-step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example of Method Chaining:\n",
        "class Car:\n",
        "    def __init__(self, make, model):\n",
        "        self.make = make\n",

        "        self.year = year\n",

        "\n",
        "    def display_info(self):\n",
        "        print(f\"Car: {self.make} {self.model}, Color: {self.color}, Year: {self.year}\")\n",

        "# Creating a Car object and chaining methods\n",
        "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",

        "Q25- What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. This special method is part of Python's \"dunder methods\" (double underscore methods) and is one of the magic methods that enables behavior customization in Python. When an object is called using parentheses (i.e., object()), Python looks for the __call__ method and invokes it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of the __call__ Method:\n",
        "Making Objects Callable:\n",
        "The main purpose of the __call__ method is to enable instances of a class to be called as if they were functions. This can be useful for situations where we want an object to behave like a function, but still retain its state.\n",
        "\n",
        "Callable Objects (Functors):\n",
        "It allows to make callable objects (also known as functors in other programming languages). This is useful when we want objects to encapsulate functionality while preserving state, and you still want to use them in a function-like manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Customizing Behavior on Call:\n",
        "We can define how the object behaves when it is called, including processing arguments, modifying state, or performing complex computations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Decorator Patterns or Higher-Order Functions:\n",
        "The __call__ method can be useful when implementing patterns like decorators or creating objects that act as functions themselves.\n",
